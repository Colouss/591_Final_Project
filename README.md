# 591_Final_Project

I've chosen the cutoff radius and parallax so that it both tries to trim out the outrageously outlier stars, but still try to keep the core somewhat distinguishable.
Then, I try to fit the reddening so that the cluster somewhat lines up with the contour lines of the isochrone layouts, so that I can later choose a best fit. (Negative values means the clusters are blue-shifted, while positive values means the clusters are red-shifted)
Once I correct for the reddening, I then choose a single isochrone line that seems to best match up with the clusters to approximate its age.
